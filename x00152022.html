        <h1>Website Overview</h1>
        <p>Designed as a professional online CV, this website puts forth skills, accomplishments, and personality. It has been built from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5 - designed to
            work on desktop (with large displays), tablets, and mobile. This optimisation extends to functionality testing across Android and iOS to preserve the user experience, regardless of device used to access.</p>
            <p>It projects to prospective employers key details that they should know.
            At a glance you can glean aspects of personality, work ethic, and commitment, as well as being able to drill down for more information.
        </p>
        <p>The user has been kept in the foreground for this design - presenting only relevant information at all times. Upon loading the website, you are greeted with a full page hero
            picture, overlaid with my name, and areas of primary interest. If you hover on the title on the hero component, a popover will show areas of key interest, styled
            in a way that resembles an old-school terminal. This is to reward exploration, and encourage it for further in the page. Simplicity is key.
        </p>
        <p>Navigation is smooth, and optimised for various screens - there are sub-components that were deemed non-essential (projects & interests) that will disappear on small screens,
            before the menu collapses to a mobile-friendly hamburger style. The navigation bar is right aligned, and so for mobile menu, this has been preserved to improve muscle memory for
            repeat visitors. The brand image is a headshot, to remind visitors of where they are, as well as to instill confidence. The navigation features scrollspy, highlighting where the
            user is on the page.
        </p>
        <p>On most devices, there is a parallax scrolling effect, to give a smoother overall appearance. Unfortunately this is not compatible with iOS devices, and has been disabled for them.
            The overall experience is preserved with optimised images, however the scrolling effect is absent.
        </p>
        <p>There is a breif "About" section, showing the brand image in a larger context, as well as reaffirming primary points to the user. They can see areas of skills/work quickly and easily,
            further emphasised by the visual queues of the customised list elements. A contact button allows a modal menu to appear, providing a number of ways to make contact - this menu
            opens all links in a new tab, to preserve the browsing experience. The button colour was set to green as it is associated with phone icons.
        </p>
        <p>In the next section, the dark colourscheme returns to create a divider, and show the user they are making progress. Each skill is in its own card, in a carousel showing two at a time.
            There are two methods to control the carousel; indicators and side-arrows. This way the user can explore more skills, or keep scrolling if they're not interested. Similarly, the
            web page encourages exploration - if the user clicks a skill card, a modal window with more information will appear. Inside this window, they can proceed to the contact section (on desktop), or
            open a contact modal window (on mobile). This functionality is hinted at by tooltips on hover, however the user is not bombarded with information.
        </p>
        <p>The majority of sections are broken up by parallax scrolling with images that are warm, contrasting with the dark theme to subconsciously demonstrate warmth to the user. The work experience
            section is centered in the page, to provide a comfortable reading experience, bordered in white, with a light background to subconsciously draw the eye to the main content. The 
            dark theme is preserved in the accordion headings. None are active as standard, prompting interaction from the user - each accordion collapses the others, keeping the focus on a single
            point in time. The text was written in a way to demonstrate my thought process and personality type, setting myself apart from the crowd without sacrificing professionalism.
        </p><p>
            The education section takes its visual design cues from the preceeding section, reinforcing the theme for the user. It is laid out in a way to pull attention to the important areas.
            Each area of education has a dedicated tab, and internal navigation promoting further exploration. The side navigation is hidden on mobile, making the most of the screen real estate.
            There are progress bars for all sections indicating completion, and in the case of 4th year, a 40% bar illustrating its "in-progress status". Every institution has their brand shown,
            linked should the user will to investigate the caliber of institution. The main body of the education section is light, bordered with white, with white for the information section subtly
            drawing the user's eye.
        </p>
        <p>The project seciton implements accordion headings in the same style as work experience, emphasising the page's theme further. These projects have header images giving it a "real" feel.
            It is a brief section, as many of the questions it answers are addressed in other areas. Still, it furthers the design ethos of rewarding exploration.
        </p>
        <p>The Hobbies & Interests section utilises the parallax scrolling with a warm image, showcasing some interests in and of itself, whilst the main section helps showcase more individuality,
            as well as highlighting the interests themselves. Each interest is given visual confirmation via customised li elements from bootstrap, and thanks to the curator.io social media feed below,
            the user can explore these interests with considerable ease.
        </p>
        <p>The web page ends with the contact section - this was done because it is the most searched for item on most webpages. Users typically look in about, and then navigate to the end for contact details.
            In this way the page meets the user's expectations, and provides details in an easy-to-use format. Each item has a custom icon, reinforcing their distinct elements. All links open in a new tab.
            This section is capped off by a footer, to close out the theme and reinforce the dark colourscheme.
